This is a project that I completed as part of [Almdrasa.com](https://almdrasa.com/) coding challenge.
The main goal of the project was to create a responsive app using HTML, CSS (BEM), Flexbox, CSS grid, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

You will be able to:

•  Add new todos to the list

•  Mark todos as complete

•  Delete todos from the list

•  Filter by all/active/complete todos

•  Clear all completed todos

•  Toggle light and dark mode

•  View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size

•  Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were utilized in this project:

•  HTML

•  CSS (BEM)

•  Flexbox

•  CSS Grid

•  JavaScript

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, SASS and JavaScript. You will also need to have a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) installed on your computer.

To view the app, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The website should display correctly in the browser.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project was a great opportunity to practice my HTML, CSS, SASS and JavaSCript skills. The use of Flexbox and CSS Grid helped to create a flexible and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. I believe that this project has helped me to become a better front-end developer, and I look forward to continuing to improve my skills in the future.
